Warnings:

constant_polyMesh_faces.rar file has to be added to /constant/polyMesh/ directory after unzipping to an ascii text file (the file was to heavy to push it directly to GitHub)

createPatchDict can be used to merge two contact regions into one patch by adding the file to /system/ directory and running in the console
